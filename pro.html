    <h1>Welcome to Hire 3.0</h1>
    <br>
    <p><b>We connect top blockchain developers with leading blockchain companies. Here's how it works</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>  Welcome to Hire 3.0, the premier platform connecting top-tier developers with reputable companies within the exciting and constantly-evolving world of blockchain technology.

As a developer looking to join Hire 3.0, the first step is to fill out a comprehensive registration form detailing your personal and professional information, as well as your educational background. This information will be used to create your unique profile, which will be accessible to companies searching for talented and qualified candidates like yourself.

But we don't just let anyone join Hire 3.0. In order to ensure that only the most skilled and knowledgeable developers are a part of our platform, we require all applicants to take a rigorous test designed to assess your expertise in the field of blockchain. Those who pass this test with a qualifying score will receive an invitation to join Hire 3.0 via email, granting them access to their personal dashboard where they can see which companies their profile has been sent to.

Of course, it's not just developers who can join Hire 3.0. Companies looking to hire top talent within the blockchain industry can also become a part of our platform by filling out a registration form with information about their business. However, we take the screening process for companies very seriously, carefully reviewing all applications before approving registration and sending out invitations to join via email. Once a company is a part of Hire 3.0, they will have access to their dashboard where they can view profiles of developers who have been matched with their company and choose to accept or reject them.

If a developer is lucky enough to be hired by a company through Hire 3.0, and their annual salary exceeds the impressive sum of INR 15 lakhs, they will be required to pay a percentage of their salary to Hire 3.0 for the next three years. This helps us continue to provide an unparalleled platform connecting the best developers with the best companies. In addition to the developer's contribution, the hiring company will also pay a lump sum to Hire 3.0, recognizing the value we bring to the table in facilitating successful employment matches.

By offering a streamlined and efficient way for developers and companies to connect, Hire 3.0 is revolutionizing the way the blockchain industry approaches hiring and employment. We look forward to helping you achieve your professional goals and build a successful career in this exciting field.         </li>
